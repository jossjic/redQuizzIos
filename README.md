## GameViewModel

### Main Methods

#### fetchData
```swift
func fetchData(completion: @escaping CompletionHandler)
```
This method retrieves the questions from the "questions" collection in Firestore. The questions are stored in the `questions` property of the `GameViewModel`. Completion is called when data retrieval is complete.

#### createQuestion
```swift
func createQuestion(question: String, category: String, correct: String, incorrect1: String, incorrect2: String, incorrect3: String, points: Int, completion: @escaping CompletionHandler)
```
Creates a new question in Firestore with the provided data. Then, it calls completion once the operation is complete.

#### deleteQuestion
```swift
func deleteQuestion(id: String, completion: @escaping CompletionHandler)
```
Deletes a specific question from Firestore based on its identifier (`id`). Completion is called after the operation is complete.

#### updateQuestion
```swift
func updateQuestion(id: String, question: String, category: String, correct: String, incorrect1: String, incorrect2: String, incorrect3: String, points: Int, completion: @escaping CompletionHandler)
```
Updates an existing question in Firestore with new data. It also updates the question locally in the `questions` property. Completion is called when the operation is complete.

## UserViewModel

### Main Methods

#### fetchData
```swift
func fetchData(completion: @escaping CompletionHandler)
```
Retrieves data of the current user from Firestore. Completion is called when data retrieval is complete.

#### updateLives
```swift
func updateLives(newLives: Int)
```
Updates the user's number of lives in Firestore and locally in the user model.

#### fetchCT
```swift
func fetchCT(completion: @escaping CompletionHandler)
```
Retrieves the user's correct (`correctTally`) and total attempts (`totalTally`) from Firestore. Completion is called when data retrieval is complete.

#### updateCT
```swift
func updateCT(cOrT: Bool)
```
Updates the user's correct (`correctTally`) or total attempts (`totalTally`) in Firestore. It calls `fetchCT` internally before performing the update.

#### updateScore
```swift
func updateScore(score: Int, type: String)
```
Updates the user's score in Firestore based on the specified category type.

#### fetchCat
```swift
func fetchCat(collection: String, completion: @escaping CompletionHandler)
```
Retrieves the user's accumulated score for a specific category from Firestore.

#### fetchRewards
```swift
func fetchRewards(completion: @escaping CompletionHandler)
```
Retrieves the user's rewards from Firestore and stores the results in the `rewardsArray` property.

#### updateRewards
```swift
func updateRewards(withScore score: Int, completion: @escaping CompletionHandler)
```
Updates the user's rewards in Firestore based on the provided score. Calls completion when the operation is complete.

This README provides an overview of the main functions of the data models. Be sure to understand the necessary Firebase dependencies and configurations before running the application. Have fun developing! üöÄ
