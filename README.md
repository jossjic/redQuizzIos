## GameViewModel

### Main Methods

#### fetchData
```swift
func fetchData(completion: @escaping CompletionHandler)
```
This method retrieves questions from the "questions" collection in Firestore. The questions are stored in the `questions` property of the `GameViewModel`. Completion is called when data retrieval is complete.

#### createQuestion
```swift
func createQuestion(question: String, category: String, correct: String, incorrect1: String, incorrect2: String, incorrect3: String, points: Int, completion: @escaping CompletionHandler)
```
Creates a new question in Firestore with the provided data. Then, calls completion once the operation is complete.

#### deleteQuestion
```swift
func deleteQuestion(id: String, completion: @escaping CompletionHandler)
```
Deletes a specific question from Firestore based on its identifier (`id`). Completion is called after the operation is complete.

#### updateQuestion
```swift
func updateQuestion(id: String, question: String, category: String, correct: String, incorrect1: String, incorrect2: String, incorrect3: String, points: Int, completion: @escaping CompletionHandler)
```
Updates an existing question in Firestore with new data. Also updates the question locally in the `questions` property. Completion is called when the operation is complete.

## UserViewModel
